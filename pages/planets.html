      <div class="grid">
	
	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Mercury.png"/>
	  <h2>Mercury</h2>
	  <p>Mercury is the closest planet to our Sun. It is also one of the four rocky planets in our solar system. Mercury is larger than our moon, but the smallest planet, now that Pluto has been re-classified.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Venus.gif"/>
	  <h2>Venus</h2>
	  <p>Venus is the second planet from the sun. It is a terrible place, due to its extremely hot temperatures. 800 degrees fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead. It also rains sulferic acid, yikes!</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Earth.png"/>
	  <h2>Earth</h2>
	  <p>This is our home! Liquid water is abundant, good thing to, as it is, as far as we understand, a critical ingredient for life. In the search for life, we look for liquid water.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Mars.png"/>
	  <h2>Mars</h2>
	  <p>A red planet named after the god of war, it resembles blood, afterall... smaller than earth, only about half the size, it is the last of the four rocky planets and the furthest from the Sun. Us humans hope to visit it in person someday soon.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Jupiter.png"/>
	  <h2>Jupiter</h2>
	  <p>A huge planet! Also the first of the gas giants. Jupiter though, is the king planet. Every other planet could fit inside it with room to spare. Full of gases, and relatively little solids.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Saturn.png"/>
	  <h2>Saturn</h2>
	  <p>The next planet out from Jupiter. It resembles jupiter in some ways, at least in its composition. Much larger than rocky planets, but not nearly as large as Jupiter. It's system of rings are a wonder to behold.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Uranus.png"/>
	  <h2>Uranus</h2>
	  <p>A blue-ish green color, this planet has a very different rotation than most other planets. The axis of other planets are like earth, mostly up and down. Uranus' axis is sideways...</p>
	</div>

	<div class="card">
	  <img src="../pics/Neptune.png"/>
	  <h2>Neptune</h2>
	  <p>A blue planet that is the last and furthest from the Sun. Features a dark blue "spot" of storming gases, much like Jupiters well-known red spot.</p>
